**Prototype Legal Nonprofit Challenge Elicitation**

* This is a [CIVICS.com](http://civics.com) concept flow by [Dazza Greenwood](http://dazzagreenwood.com) for http://www.mclegalhackathon.org
* View a working prototype, which enables legal nonprofits to pose their challenges in a brainstorm round and hone the challenges at the upcoming bootcamp and in subsequent online iterations: [https://musiccitylegalhackathon.github.io/2017-Problems](https://musiccitylegalhackathon.github.io/2017-Problems) and the corresonding  form intake for potential solutions proposed for hackathon teams and/or unconference breakout groups to develop: [https://musiccitylegalhackathon.github.io/2017-Proposals](https://musiccitylegalhackathon.github.io/2017-Proposals) (note how the "proposed solutions" form is dynamically "self-updating" to reflect the then current pool of problems and challenges).

# Brainstorm Potential Hackathon & Unconference Challenges

The form embedded below is a prototype.  The form demonstrates a process for legal nonprofits (pro bono and low bono organizations) to brainstorm which problems or challenges they would like teams to work on at the Music City Legal Hackathon.  Legal nonprofits are strongly encouraged to attend the Stakeholder Bootcamp on  February 25, 2017 from 9:30-12:00pm at Vanderbilt Law School to learn how to create a clear problem statement and request for proposed solutions that project teams and break-out groups can develop at the Music City Legal Hackathon and Unconference, here: http://www.mclegalhackathon.org/#bootcamps
